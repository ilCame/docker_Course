Docker Compose

docker compose is a tool that allow to replace multiple/single docker builds and docker run comands with just one configuration file;

docker compose will not replace dockerFiles, they work together, docker compose does not replace images or containers and also docker compose is not suited for managing multiple containers on different host machine.


std_open: true
    tty: true

in the docker compose file, is used for setting the container in interactive mode. 
std_open is used to let docker know that the service need an open input connection.

Docker Utility Contaniners

Utility containers are containers witch only have a certain environment in them, the idea is that they don't start an application when you run them but
you run them with some command specified by you and execute a certain task.

A Karavek & PHP Dockerized Project

./src:/var/www/html:delegated on volumes on the docker file, the delegated part is used so that if the container should write some data there it's not instantly reflected back to the host machine, instead it is besically processed in bathces. it'a optimization.

Deploying Docker containers:

In a Dev environment containers should encapsulate the runtime environment but not necessarily the code. use Bind Mounts to provide your local host
project files to the running containers. this allows for instant updates without restarting the container.

For production the container works standalone, you should not have source code on your remote machine. image / container is the single source truth. so in production we will use copy instead of bind mounts to copy a code snapshot into the image. this ensures that evry image runs without any extra, surrounding configuration or code
